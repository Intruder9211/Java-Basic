Time & Space Complexity

Space Complexity 
Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input. It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time. 
For example: int consumes 4 bytes of memory.
